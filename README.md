# scripts
Collection of scripts to set up Mighty Canary.
## Running a Script
If you are running a bash script, you need a computer that runs bash. 
1. Download the script, for example *set_tableau_webhooks_using_token.sh*
2. Run the script:
```bash
bash ./set_tableau_webhooks_using_token.sh
```
### Powershell Script
We also have a script that runs on PowerShell. The proceedure is the same.
1. Download the script, e.g. *set_tableau_webhooks_using_token.ps1*
2. Run the Powershell script:
```powershell
./set_tableau_webhooks_using_token.ps1
```
